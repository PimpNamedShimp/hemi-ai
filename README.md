                Hemispherical AI
                
                conceived by: Eric Bishop
                
                inspired by: Science-Fiction turned                     to fact!!! and of course... Jonny5! (totally awsome shorthand or nickname for H.A.I.)!
 
    	Hemispheric A.I. was a thesis written roughly a year ago (thanks, Jonny5!). In a nut shell it makes the implication that ai modeling be based off a sentient, mammalian, hemispherical brain model, and quite eloquently goes on to colorfully elaborate why. It's very well written. I'm going to post the link, so anyone who wants can check that out.

	My theory of Hemispherical AI is a network-oriented machine-learning/"machine-learned" process framed by Microsoft's Qsharp concept of "superpositioning". It shall use endpoint connections and handshakes in order to query particular and/or multiple metadata sets, cryptography, telemetry, etc, using "snapshot-bots". These bots, comprised with said info, then correspond with all other previously spawned instances. In theory, this correspondance creates a scenario in which every cell (snapshot-bot) of each hemisphere (network-sphere) can then persist and adapt accordingly to changing apis, parameters, and all other variables of the like. By these means, I hope that the cells can then learn to spawn instances and working configurations on their own to continue persistance across previously established instances in order to create a condition I call "endpoint-omnipresence" 
   
	In order to put into practice a proof-of-concept, initial steps were taken on a formerly installed m2.nvme ssd drive, which contains some of the first spawned web assemblies. This, I'm considering to make it a broiler-plate scenario. For now...

	Here's the draft for our recipe so far. I expected this would end up having to be a collaborative effort, and one perhaps that many might see good reason to be enthusiastic to accomplish this in support of Open-Source dev.

Fork off of Q-sharp & qsharp-compiler. compile primal, static web-assemblies in rust that use preact nodes that generate go buildozer scripts. 

These in turn will act as another, flavorInjector or burnNturn react/preact, so snapshots built from bazel have ability to interject new parameters, apis, and conditions or to scrap the existing non-compatible build in for a new one.

All the while, poetry, will be assisting with build, but also will act as re-evalution client or reassertion agent. this python scripting will also be defined as methodCalls, by responsive node queries.

These are just among some of the methods I am proposing right now in order to create desired state of persistence all across the board. Working on cloud and network utilities and provisions for web assemblies now. Using AWS powershell modules and aws cmd. Hoping to next create correspondence loops from GitHub repository (in so many words) and want to try to use s3 buckets as "bot fuel" somehow...
